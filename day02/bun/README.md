# Bun

The main code for solving the challenges goes in the calculate function in `part1.js` and `part2.js`. You put your puzzle input and the examples into `input.txt` and `example.txt` one directory level above this file. In order to use the tests you need to fix value `expected` in the files `part1.test.js` and `part2.test.js` according to what the examples give as answer.

## Run part 1
```bash
bun part1
```
## Test part 1
```bash
bun test-part1
```
## Run part 2
```bash
bun part2
```
## Test part 2
```bash
bun test-part2
```
