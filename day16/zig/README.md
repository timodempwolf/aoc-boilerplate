# Rust

The main code for solving the challenges goes in the calculate function in `src/part1.zig` and `src/part2.zig`. You put your puzzle input and the examples into `input.txt` and `example.txt` one directory level above this file. In order to use the tests you need to fix value `expected` in the files `src/part1.zig` and `src/part2.zig` according to what the examples give as answer.

## Run part 1
```bash
zig build run-part1
```
## Test part 1
```bash
zig build test-part1
```
## Run part 2
```bash
zig build run-part2
```
## Test part 2
```bash
zig build test-part2

```
