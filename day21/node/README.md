# Node

The main code for solving the challenges goes in the calculate function in `part1.js` and `part2.js`. You put your puzzle input and the examples into `input.txt` and `example.txt` one directory level above this file. In order to use the tests you need to fix value `expected` in the files `part1_test.js` and `part2_test.js` according to what the examples give as answer. This is using the node native test runner which was introduced in node 20.

## Run part 1
```bash
node part1.js
```
## Test part 1
```bash
node --test part1_test.js
```
## Run part 2
```bash
node part2.js
```
## Test part 2
```bash
node --test part2_test.js


```
