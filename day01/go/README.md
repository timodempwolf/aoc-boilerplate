# Go

The main code for solving the challenges goes in the calculate function in `part1/main.go` and `part2/main.go`. You put your puzzle input and the examples into `input.txt` and `example.txt` one directory level above this file. In order to use the tests you need to fix value `want` in the files `part1/main_test.go` and `part2/main_test.go` according to what the examples give as answer.

## Run part 1
```bash
go run ./part1
```
## Test part 1
```bash
go test ./part1
```
## Run part 2
```bash
go run ./part2
```
## Test part 2
```bash
go test ./part2
```
