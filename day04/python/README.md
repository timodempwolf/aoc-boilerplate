# Python

The main code for solving the challenges goes in the calculate function in `part1.py` and `part2.py`. You put your puzzle input and the examples into `input.txt` and `example.txt` one directory level above this file. In order to use the tests you need to fix value `expected` in the files `part1_test.py` and `part2_test.py` according to what the examples give as answer.

## Run part 1
```bash
python part1.py
```
## Test part 1
```bash
python -m unittest part1_test.py
```
## Run part 2
```bash
python part2.py
```
## Test part 2
```bash
python -m unittest part2_test.py


```
